# First-Js-project

This is my first To-Do List App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks in a simple and responsive interface.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Mobile-friendly design

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Type a task in the input field.
3. Add it to the list, check it off when done, or delete it if no longer needed.

## Future Plans
- Save tasks using local storage
- Add categories or priorities
- Add dark mode
